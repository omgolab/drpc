# DRPC Product Context

## Problem Statement
Building distributed systems requires reliable communication between services. Traditional RPC mechanisms often lack features needed for modern applications, such as bidirectional streaming, efficient serialization, and cross-language support.

## Solution
DRPC addresses these challenges by providing:
1. A language-agnostic protocol for service-to-service communication
2. Implementations in both Go and TypeScript
3. Support for different communication patterns (request-response, streaming)
4. Built-in authentication and error handling

## User Experience Goals
- Developers should be able to define services with minimal boilerplate
- API should be intuitive and consistent across languages
- Error handling should be straightforward and informative
- Setup and configuration should be simple and well-documented
- Performance overhead should be minimal

## Target Users
- Backend developers building distributed systems
- Teams working with microservices architectures
- Developers working in polyglot environments (Go + TypeScript/JavaScript)
