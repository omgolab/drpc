# DRPC Project Progress

## What Works

- Project structure initialized
- Basic Go implementation components (Client, Server, Core)
- Basic TypeScript implementation components
- **Integration Tests (`pkg/drpc/client_integration_test.go`):**
    - `TestPath1_HTTPDirect`: PASSING

## What's Left to Build

- Core protocol definition refinement
- Go implementation:
    - Fix remaining tests.
    - Implement server logic to utilize discovered relays.
- TypeScript implementation:
    - Client implementations that reflects Go clinet and works in the browser
- Documentation improvements
- **Tests:**
    - Fix failing integration tests (see Known Issues)
    - Expand unit test coverage
    - Add end-to-end tests

## Current Status

Core DRPC functionality is partially implemented in Go and TypeScript. The server can now discover potential relay peers dynamically via DHT, but doesn't yet actively use them. Integration tests reveal issues with libp2p transport, particularly relaying and direct streaming compatibility with ConnectRPC.

## Known Issues

- **Integration Test Failures (`pkg/drpc/client_integration_test.go`):**
    - `TestPath2_HTTPGatewayRelay`: FAILING (Timeout: gateway cannot open relayed stream).
    - `TestPath3_LibP2PDirect`: FAILING (Streaming Error: ConnectRPC over direct libp2p stream incompatible).
    - `TestPath4_LibP2PRelay`: FAILING (Timeout: client cannot connect via relay).
- **LibP2P Compatibility:** Potential incompatibility between ConnectRPC streaming and direct libp2p streams needs investigation.
- **LibP2P Relaying:** Issues exist with establishing and maintaining relayed connections for DRPC communication.
