# System Patterns

This document describes the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, and component relationships for the DRPC project.

## System Architecture

The DRPC system will likely follow a client-server architecture, where clients can make requests to servers that expose remote procedures.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Use of Go and TypeScript for cross-language compatibility.
- (Further technical decisions will be documented here as the project progresses.)

## Design Patterns

- (Design patterns will be documented here as they are implemented.)

## Component Relationships

- (Component relationships will be documented here as the project evolves.)
