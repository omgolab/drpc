# Active Context

## Current Focus: Refactor `bridge-server.go` (v2) for Efficiency and Connect Library Usage

The primary goal is to refactor `examples/simple-hello/bridge2/bridge-server.go` to use `connectrpc.com/connect` library's exposed types for envelope handling (specifically `Envelope` and `FlagEnvelopeEndStream`) and error propagation, removing custom implementations. This is part of making the server highly efficient for a http-libp2p communication library.

## Current Blocker: Go Module Resolution Issue

We are currently blocked by an issue with Go's module tooling. The `connectrpc.com/connect@v1.18.1` module, which is correctly specified in `go.mod`, is reported by `go mod tidy` and the compiler as _not containing_ the sub-package `connectrpc.com/connect/protocol`. This is despite evidence from the library's source code on GitHub and documentation on pkg.go.dev that this sub-package and the required types (`Envelope`, `FlagEnvelopeEndStream`) exist at v1.18.1.

The error is: `module connectrpc.com/connect@latest found (v1.18.1), but does not contain package connectrpc.com/connect/protocol`.

This prevents the compilation of `bridge-server.go` when attempting to import `connectrpc.com/connect/protocol`.

## Recent Changes

- Attempted to modify `examples/simple-hello/bridge2/bridge-server.go` to import `connectrpc.com/connect/protocol` and use `protocol.Envelope` and `protocol.FlagEnvelopeEndStream`.
- Ran `go mod tidy`, which failed with the error mentioned above.
- Verified `go.mod` contains `require connectrpc.com/connect v1.18.1`.
- Confirmed via GitHub and pkg.go.dev that `connectrpc.com/connect/protocol` should be a valid package path for v1.18.1 of the library.

## Next Steps

The immediate next step depends on resolving the Go module import issue:

1.  **Resolve Go Environment/Tooling Issue:** The user needs to investigate why the local Go environment cannot correctly resolve the `connectrpc.com/connect/protocol` sub-package. This could involve clearing the Go module cache, checking Go proxy settings, or other environment-specific troubleshooting.
2.  **Alternative Implementation Strategy:** If the import issue cannot be resolved, we need to decide on an alternative:
    - Revert to custom envelope handling in `bridge-server.go`.
    - Explore other (if any) exposed APIs from `connectrpc.com/connect` that might allow for raw stream adaptation without directly using the `Envelope` type from the `protocol` sub-package.

The refactoring of `bridge-server.go` and subsequent testing with `bridge-final.test.ts` are on hold until this import issue is addressed.
