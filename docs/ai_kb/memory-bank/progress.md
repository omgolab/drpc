# DRPC Project Progress

## What Works

- Project structure initialized
- Basic Go implementation components (Client, Server, Core)
- Basic TypeScript implementation components
- **Integration Tests (`pkg/drpc/client_integration_test.go`):**
    - `TestPath1_HTTPDirect`: PASSING

## What's Left to Build

- Core protocol definition refinement
- Go implementation:
    - Fix remaining tests
- TypeScript implementation:
    - Client implementations that reflects Go clinet and works in the browser
- Documentation improvements
- **Tests:**
    - Fix failing integration tests (see Known Issues)
    - Expand unit test coverage
    - Add end-to-end tests

## Current Status

Core DRPC functionality is partially implemented in Go and TypeScript. Integration tests reveal issues with libp2p transport, particularly relaying and direct streaming compatibility with ConnectRPC.

## Known Issues

- **Integration Test Failures (`pkg/drpc/client_integration_test.go`):**
    - `TestPath2_HTTPGatewayRelay`: FAILING (Timeout: gateway cannot open relayed stream).
    - `TestPath3_LibP2PDirect`: FAILING (Streaming Error: ConnectRPC over direct libp2p stream incompatible).
    - `TestPath4_LibP2PRelay`: FAILING (Timeout: client cannot connect via relay).
- **LibP2P Compatibility:** Potential incompatibility between ConnectRPC streaming and direct libp2p streams needs investigation.
- **LibP2P Relaying:** Issues exist with establishing and maintaining relayed connections for DRPC communication.
