# dRPC Project Brief

## Overview

dRPC (Distributed RPC) is a library implementing a distributed remote procedure call system. It enables seamless communication between distributed services across different environments and languages.

## Core Requirements

- Implement a language-agnostic RPC protocol
- Support for both Go and TypeScript implementations
- Provide efficient serialization and deserialization
- Handle error propagation across network boundaries
- Enable bidirectional streaming capabilities
- Support for authentication and authorization
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Project Goals

- Create a reliable and performant distributed communication system
- Ensure compatibility between Go and TypeScript implementations
- Provide simple, intuitive APIs for developers
- Implement robust error handling and recovery
- Create comprehensive documentation and examples
- Ensure testability of all components

## Scope

- Core RPC protocol implementation
- Client and server libraries for Go and TypeScript
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Error handling and recovery
- Examples and documentation
