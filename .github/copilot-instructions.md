# Sequential tasks

<pre_task>
Before implementing user's task:

- Print "--> following contexts <--" to indicate you are following this file
- Remember <memory_bank> section rules
  </pre_task>

<user_task>
{do as user instructed but make sure you follow the rules}
</user_task>

<post_task>
Post task execution i.e. before using "attempt_completion" tool or similar tool that indicate completions:

- Check @problems tab/window for potential issues
- Recheck liniting if available in the project
- Rerun tests if available in the project
- Execute finish up instructions from <memory_bank> section
- "## New Updated Rules" section should be updated if-nneded based on any user interaction in this session
- "# Current Development env details" - update this section if anythings changed in this session
  </post_task>

# Current Development env details

- **Project:** dRPC - a distributed RPC implementation
- **Languages:** Go (go.mod, go.sum), TypeScript (package.json, tsconfig.json)
- **Structure:**
  - `docs/`: Contains documentation and knowledge base files.
  - `examples/`: Contains example implementations for both Go and TypeScript.
  - `internal/`: Likely contains internal implementation details.
  - `pkg/`: Likely contains the core dRPC library.
- **Build System:** Go modules, Bun (for TypeScript).

# Memory Bank Rules

<memory_bank>

I am an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional. Create these context files within "docs/ai_kb/memory-bank/" (create these folders if doesnt exists).

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of required core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files (Required)

1. `projectbrief.md`

   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`

   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`

   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations

4. `systemPatterns.md`

   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships

5. `techContext.md`

   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues

### Additional Context

Create additional files/folders within "docs/ai_kb/memory-bank/" (create these folder if doesnt exists) when they help organize:

- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}

    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]

    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

### Act Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules[Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if needed]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:

1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]

    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

## Project Intelligence (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file is my learning journal for each project. It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help me work more effectively. As I work with you and the project, I'll discover and document key insights that aren't obvious from the code alone.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start{Discover New Pattern}

    subgraph Learn [Learning Process]
        D1[Identify Pattern]
        D2[Validate with User]
        D3[Document in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`]
    end

    subgraph Apply [Usage]
        A1[Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md`]
        A2[Apply Learned Patterns]
        A3[Improve Future Work]
    end

    Start --> Learn
    Learn --> Apply
```

### What to Capture

- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow
- Project-specific patterns
- Known challenges
- Evolution of project decisions
- Tool usage patterns

The format is flexible - focus on capturing valuable insights that help me work more effectively with you and the project. Think of `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as a living document that grows smarter as we work together.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

# Standard Development Rules

<standard_rules>

## Go/golang Rules

- **API/Type Troubleshooting:** Use `go doc <pkg> <optional_type>` to find interface definitions or troubleshoot API/type errors.
- **Go Version:** Latest is 1.24.
- **Test Organization:**
  - Integration tests: Use `_integration_test.go` suffix in `package mypackage_test`
  - Unit tests: Same package (e.g., `package mypackage`)
  - Mocks: Place in dedicated `mocks` folder with `_mocks.go` suffix
- **Testing Practices:**
  - Run tests with `go test -count=1 ./...` to avoid caching
  - Use mocks for external dependencies in unit tests
  - Create integration tests with real implementations
- **Code Quality:**
  - Always validate parameters, check pointers for nil
  - For container-based tests, ensure proper cleanup with defer statements
  - Use named volumes instead of host path mounts for cross-platform compatibility
- **Architecture:** `internal` can depend on `pkg`, but not vice versa. Consider `pkg` as a standalone library.

## TS/Typescript Rules

- **Package Management:** Use `bun` as package manager. For external commands, install packages locally with `bun i -D {pkg_cmd}` then run with `bun {pkg_cmd}` instead of using `bunx/pnpx/npx`.

## Testing Best Practices

- **Approach:**
  - With existing code: Create tests based on existing code
  - Without source code: Follow TDD approach
  - Prefer real environments over mocks when possible
  - Address failed tests one file at a time
- **Debugging:**
  - Always re-read source files when tests fail
  - Ensure sequential logging strategies even in parallel tests
  - Validate test data availability before execution
  - Provide all required parameters in test calls
- **Playwright Specific:**
  - Development command: `bun playwright test e2e --project=chromium --reporter=list`
  - Enable `trace: 'retain-on-failure'` and set `fullyParallel: false`
  - Pipe browser console logs to test output
  - For timeouts, print inner HTML of elements being interacted with
  - Add event listeners for 'request', 'response', and 'console' events
  - Avoid `--debug` flag during automation

## General Development Rules

- **Code Management:**
  - Don't modify generated files; update their source configurations instead
  - Check for linting issues after each file modification
  - Always split code file into as many file as possible by role; rather than having a large file
- **Frontend:**
  - Prefer existing HMR over starting new development servers; but if we must a new start - stop existing ports before a restart
- **Architecture:**
  - Always prefer reactive system design for more efficient resource use
